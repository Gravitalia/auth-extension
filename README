Auth Extension
--------------

Extension to create serverless tokens for authentication.

How it works:
1. Generates an RSA key-pair.
2. Stores the private key on device(a), sends public key to the host server(b).
3. Device generates token using the on-device private key.
4. Token(c) is passed to the end-website for identity providing.
End-website can check token validity using host server(b).

(a) private key is saved in device's vault.
(b) host server could be a self-hosted server or a public one.
(c) token is a JSON Web Token (JWT).
